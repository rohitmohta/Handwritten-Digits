# Handwritten-Digits
It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict.

Different machine learning techniques were applied and accuracy was find using the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem. Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered. 
This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on machine learning with very little data cleaning or preparation required. 
Each image is a 28 by 28-pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.
